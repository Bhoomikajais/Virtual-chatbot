# 🤖 Virtual Chatbot with GUI, Voice, and Wikipedia Integration

This is a beginner-to-intermediate level Python project built to showcase key programming skills, including GUI development, voice recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, JSON handling, and integration with external APIs (like Wikipedia). It's an intelligent virtual assistant that you can **chat with using both text and voice**, and it **responds with relevant answers, date/time, and summaries from Wikipedia**.


## 📌 Features

- ✅ **User-friendly GUI** using `Tkinter`
- 🎤 **Voice input** and speech recognition via `speech_recognition`
- 🔊 **Text-to-speech replies** using `pyttsx3`
- 🌐 **Wikipedia integration** for real-time answers
- 📆 **Date & Time responses**
- 💬 Supports **natural language queries**
- 🧠 Easily extendable with custom responses via `responses.json`
- 📝 **Conversation logging** to a text file

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate practical skills in:
- Core Python programming
- Working with external libraries and APIs
- Building interactive GUI applications
- Enhancing user experience with multimedia features
- Clean code structuring and modular design

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📁 Folder Structure


chatbot\_project/
├── gui\_chatbot.py       # Main Python script
├── responses.json       # Contains chatbot's response patterns
├── requirements.txt     # All required Python packages
└── README.md            # Project overview (this file)



## 💡 Sample Queries

> **You:** What is artificial intelligence?
> **Bot:** Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines... 🤓

> **You:** What’s the time today?
> **Bot:** The current time is 15:45:10 ⏰

> **You:** Bye
> **Bot:** Goodbye! Have a great day 👋


## 📂 Customization Tips

* You can update the `responses.json` file to add new conversational flows.
* To integrate more APIs (weather, jokes, etc.), modify the `get_response()` function in `gui_chatbot.py`.
